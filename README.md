millweb
=======

Its like HTML5 Boilerplate but without all the weird boilerplate

To install:
  npm install -g millweb
  
Also!! This presumes global installation of browersify and minify. I would
recommend installing those even if u don't use this cause they rule.
Feasibly I should put them in the dependencies but I figure most people
have 'em globally and wanna keep size down.

To use:
  node millweb <name_of_project>

Then a directory called <name_of_project> will magically appear! It will have
useful stuff in it!

To use the Makefile in the project use "sudo make".

Enjoy the 2 minutes saved!!!
