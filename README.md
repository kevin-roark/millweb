millweb
=======

Its like HTML5 Boilerplate but without all the weird boilerplate

To install:
  npm install -g millweb
  
Also!! This presumes global installation of browersify and minify. I would
recommend installing those even if u don't use this cause they rule.
Feasibly I should put them in the dependencies but I figure most people
have 'em globally and wanna keep size down.

How I start a project:
  make it on github
  clone it
  go to the new directory
  node millweb

Then the project directory will have a bunch of useful stuff in it!

To use the Makefile in the project use "sudo make".

Enjoy the 2 minutes saved!!!
